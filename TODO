Here is a start of a list of ideas:
Please feel free to add to it or to start implementing stuff:

 1) The file, data/mgu74v2id
   contains an environment that has the affy number linked to (the 
  genbank number??)

   It would be nice to be able to select a set of genes and
   get a webpage set up with the Affy #, and links to various
   databases (genbank in particular).

 2) We need to decide which databases we will store in data:
    -functional groups
    -basic mappings
    -proteins
    -chromasome mapping

 3) A set of tools that let us select data from a data frame (such as the 
  output of dChip) according to the data in these files.

 4) Do we want to explore a Tcl/Tk interface to selection?
