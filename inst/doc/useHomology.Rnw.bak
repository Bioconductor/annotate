\title{How to use the inparanoid packages}

\section*{Introduction}

The inparanoid packages are based upon the gene to gene orthology
groupings as determined by the inparanoid algorithm.  More details on
this algorithm can be found at the inparanoid website:
(\url{http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi}).  A nice brief
description of the inparanoid method is given by the FAQ at their
website: "The InParanoid program uses the pairwise similarity scores,
calculated using NCBI-Blast, between two complete proteomes for
constructing orthology groups. An orthology group is initially
composed of two so-called seed orthologs that are found by two-way
best hits between two proteomes. More sequences are added to the group
if there are sequences in the two proteomes that are closer to the
correpsonding seed ortholog than to any sequence in the other
proteome. These members of an orthology group are called inparalogs. A
confidence value is provided for each inparalog that shows how closely
related it is to its seed ortholog."

The Inparanoid algorithm has been run on 35 species so far.  We
provide packages for five of these species, and within the packages
for these five supported species, we provide the mappings between that
species and all 35 of the Inparanoid species.  The packages are named
as follows:

hom.Hs.inp.db for human mappings to the other 350 species
hom.Mm.inp.db for mouse mappings to the other 350 species
hom.Rn.inp.db for rat mappings to the other 350 species
hom.Dm.inp.db for fly mappings to the other 350 species
hom.Sc.inp.db for yeast mappings to the other 350 species

This vignette will discuss the different information contained within
these packages and how to use these packages to get information about
the genes that are most likely the orthologous match for a
particular gene.


\section*{Contents of the packages}

Within each inparanoid package there is a small database that contains
tables that map relationships between genes of one species and genes
of another.  For the database that is inside of the human package
(hom.Hs.inp.db) the tables will be named according to the "other"
species that they will map to.  As an example within the context of
the human package, the mus_musculus table will map relationships
between humans and mouse.  This particular table will be the exact
same table that will be inside of the mouse package (hom.Mm.inp.db),
but in that context the table will have the name homo_sapiens to
denote that in this other context is provides a mapping relationship
between mouse and humans.

In addition to this database, there are also a series of prefabricated
mappings that can be used to get the information we anticipate most
users will want.  Specifically, the reciprocal best matches or the
inparanoid "seed pairs".  These are the matches that make up most of
the inparanoid tables, and which are intended to indicate the best
matches between one gene and another in a species match-up.  So if you
have a human gene and you want to know what the likely equivalent of
that gene in mouse is, you can use the appropriate mapping to quickly
get that information.  A quick look at the mappings that are available
when you load the human package will show you these:

<<loadAndListPackages>>=
library("hom.Hs.inp.db")
ls("package:hom.Hs.inp.db")
@

What you will notice when you look at these is that these mappings all
have the format of "hom.Hs.inpXXXXX".  This indicates that they are
mappings from the human package to their respective organisms give by
a 5 character code.  Because a simple 2 letter species abbreviation is
too short to avoid redundancy when 35 species mappings are available,
we have adopted the inparanoid style of species abbreviations for
these mappings.  This means that the 1st three letters designate the
genus, and the 2nd two designate the species.  And so for example,
"MUSMU" is short for mus musculus, "DROME" is short for drosophila
melanogaster etc.  One thign to note about these mappings is that
because they are maps, the data will have been formatted into a map
form.  In most cases this detail will be completely irrelevant since
most seed pairs map 1:1.  But some seed pairs map one to many or many
to many.  In these cases, it is important to remember that the map
format will display the data as a 1:1 or 1:many relationship only.  No
data has been lost in this transformation, but it is a good idea to
keep in mind that a tiny proportion of your keys may in fact map to
the same lists of values when using maps like this.

You can of course look at the contents of a mapping in the usual way:

<<listMapping>>=
as.list(hom.Hs.inpMUSMU)[1:10]
@

When you do this you will probably notice that most of the seed
mappings are 1:1.  But you might also notice that the IDs might not be
the kinds of IDs that you normally use.  

The IDs in these mapping are the ones that were used by inparanoid in
their initial comparisons, but it is probably not a serious problem if
the inparanoid IDs are not the ones that you might have initially
wanted.  For the mainstream organisms such as mouse, human, rat,
yeast, and fly, we also provide the needed data in the organism level
packages so that you can map back from inparanoid to a more familiar
set of IDs.  Here is an example of how you can chain annotation
packages together to start with a common gene symbol for human (MSX2),
and then work over to the equivalent information in mouse (Msx2).  An
important caveat to this is that the organism level packages are
entrez gene centric.  This means that to extract meaningful
information from them, it is always necessary to map through an entrez
gene ID.


<<mapGeneExample>>=
# load the organism annotation data for human
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# get the entrex gene ID for gene symbol "MSX2"
mget("MSX2", org.Hs.egSYMBOL2EG)

# get the ensembl protein ID for the entrez gene ID "4488"
mget("4488", org.Hs.egENSEMBLPROT)

# use the inparanoid package to get the mouse gene that is considered 
# equivalent to ensembl protein ID "ENSP00000239243"
mget("ENSP00000239243", hom.Hs.inpMUSMU)

# load the organism annotation data for mouse
library(org.Mm.eg.db)

# get the entrez gene ID for Jackson labs ID "MGI:97169"
mget("MGI:97169", org.Mm.egMGI2EG)

# finally get the gene symbol for entrez gene ID "17702" from mouse
mget("17702", org.Mm.egSYMBOL)
@


This example demonstrates how the inparanoid mappings can give you a
shortcut to genes that are likely to be orthologs.  In addition, this
example shows how you can tap into a lot of desirable information
about whatever gene mappings you find by using the inparanoid package
in conjunction with the organism annotation packages and passing
through an entrez gene ID.



\subsection{Use \Rpackage{hom.Xx.Inp.db} to explore other paralogous
  relationships among organisms}

As mentioned earlier, each database has a table that contains all the
information needed to make each of the standard mappings provided.
But there is other information contained in these tables as well such
as the inparalogs and their scores.  This information can be accessed
by doing some simple queries using the DBI interface.

As an example consider the following seed pair mapping:

<<seedPairExample>>=
mget("ENSP00000301011", hom.Hs.inpMUSMU)
@

What if we wanted to know about other possible mappings that were not
seed mappings?  To do this we could use the DBI interface.  But in
order to do that we 1st have to look at what the underlying table
looks like:

<<seedPairExample2>>=
# make a connection to the human database
mycon = hom.Hs.inp_dbconn()
# make a list of all the tables that are available
dbListTables(mycon)
# make a list of the columns in the table of interest
dbListFields(mycon, "mus_musculus")
# or we could also just dump the entire schema to the screen
hom.Hs.inp_dbschema() 
@

At this point we know the name of the table, and of the colums that
this table has.  At this point we have all the information we need to
start querying the database directly.  So lets probe the database with
a simple query for all of the infomation about the ensembl protein ID
"ENSP00000301011":

<<seedPairExample3>>=
#make a query that will let us see which clust_id we need
sql = paste("SELECT * FROM mus_musculus WHERE inp_id = 'ENSP00000301011';")
dataOut = dbGetQuery(mycon, sql)
dataOut
@

Now we can see that this ID belongs to cluster ID # 1731.  So now we
can adjust our query slightly so that we pull out ALL the information
about that entire group:

<<seedPairExample4>>=
#make a query that will let us see all the data that is affiliated with a clust id
sql = paste("SELECT * FROM mus_musculus WHERE clust_id = '1731';")
dataOut = dbGetQuery(mycon, sql)
dataOut
@



% #START with R. Start with: ENSP00000301011 and MGI:1923264, (these could come up on a 1:1 map view of mouse:human
% #Then use the DBI to look at:
% SELECT * FROM mus_musculus WHERE inp_id = "ENSP00000301011";
% #THEN DO:
% SELECT * FROM mus_musculus WHERE clust_id = "1731" limit 40;
% #Which shows ID MGI:3648845 that is less closely related.  you can then get the info about what this is from the org packages and show how this is true...

% ##Each database has the mappings (as tables) which contain the seed pairs along with the scoring for non-seed pairs.

% ##Talk here about how you can use the DBI interface to go right down to the table and grab the other members of a clust_id thus getting the other related but less identical Gene IDs out...
% ## You can also filter such results by cutoff for the score. (from 1 to 0 depending how similar it is to the initial seed pair

% SELECT * FROM mus_musculus WHERE score < 1 AND species = "MUSMU" limit 40;
% SELECT * FROM mus_musculus WHERE clust_id = "1731" limit 40;
