The genes in gender.genes represent genes on the U95A chip that
are related to gender (x/y chromasomes).
The first 13 are Y's the next 34 are X

The files and their descriptions:
hgu95v2fgroup : U95v2 chip, functional group by Affy number
u95id         : Affy number index to Identifier
u95LL         : Affy number index to LocusLink
u95name       : Affy number index to gene name
LLu95         : Locuslink number to Affy #

Identifier is GenBank Accession number (unique for each sequence that a
researcher submitted to GenBank);

"FirstofLocuslink First of Name" are the first match to LocusLink

It seems that the annotation was made from the following:
So, one seems to go to these locations and grab the files. 
It would be good to have some idea of how to process/handle them.


Unigene files downloaded: Hs.data (1/9/01), Mm.data (12/18/00), Rn.data (4/9/01)


GeneOntology files downloaded: process.ontology, function.ontology, component.ontology (3/5/01)

LocusLink files downloaded: LL_tmpl.txt (8/1/01), but many files below used was constructed using an earlier version

To access a web page:
CString str(gene_info.Info[CurUnit].LocusLink);
        str = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LocRpt.cgi?l=" + str;
        ShellExecute((HWND) GetDesktopWindow(), "open",str, NULL, NULL,
+SW_SHOW);

R code for browsers
===================
locuslink <- function(geneid, lladdress) {
    if(is.na(geneid))
       stop("gene id is NA, cannot proceed")
    if(missing(lladdress))
       lladdress <- "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LocRpt.cgi?l="
    query <- paste(lladdress, geneid, sep="")
    if (is.null(getOption("browser"))) 
       stop("options(\"browser\") not set")
    browser <- getOption("browser")
    system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", 
              query, ")\" 2>/dev/null || ", browser, " ", 
              query, " &", sep = ""))
    return(invisible())
}
