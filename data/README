The genes in gender.genes represent genes on the U95A chip that
are related to gender (x/y chromasomes).
The first 13 are Y's the next 34 are X

Identifier is GenBank Accession number (unique for each sequence that a
researcher submitted to GenBank);

"FirstofLocuslink First of Name" are the first match to LocusLink

It seems that the annotation was made from the following:
So, one seems to go to these locations and grab the files. 
It would be good to have some idea of how to process/handle them.


Unigene files downloaded: Hs.data (1/9/01), Mm.data (12/18/00), Rn.data (4/9/01)


GeneOntology files downloaded: process.ontology, function.ontology, component.ontology (3/5/01)

LocusLink files downloaded: LL_tmpl.txt (8/1/01), but many files below used was constructed using an earlier version

To access a web page:
CString str(gene_info.Info[CurUnit].LocusLink);
        str = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LocRpt.cgi?l=" + str;
        ShellExecute((HWND) GetDesktopWindow(), "open",str, NULL, NULL,
+SW_SHOW);

       stop("gene id is NA, cannot proceed")

    query <- paste(lladdress, geneid, sep="")
